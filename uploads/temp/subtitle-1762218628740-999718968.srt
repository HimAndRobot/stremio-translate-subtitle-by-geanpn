1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,800
Consider: Can the universe be
justifiably called "infinite?"

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,180
Doubtful...

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,100
It may not have a discernible
end, but it had a beginning...

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,190
And its component parts

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,020
definitely have a limited
cosmological shelf life...

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,320
Splitting hairs or not,
if history tells us anything

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,740
it's that scientists often
make very poor poets...

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,870
We're a ship of
fools chasing phantoms;

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,870
heedless of what really
underwrites natural law.

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,130
Okarin.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,840
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,160
Infiltration commencing.
El. Psy. Congroo...

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,790
Over and out.

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,790
Place is a mortuary.

15
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,550
Organization stink
is all over this.

16
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,920
Why did we
come here again?

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,180
Huh? You're here because
I permit you to be.

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,730
Ooo! A time machine? Neat!

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,770
The good doctor has
beaten us to the punch,

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,650
oh devoted one...

21
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,730
He, in his unqualified hubris,

22
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,110
has broken ground on the
invention of the millennium

23
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,320
and I'm morbidly curious

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,110
to see where our theories
intersect, if at all. Hmph!

25
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,740
Huh...?!

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,830
The roof!

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,380
Eh...? What the hell?

28
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,600
Is anything not an emergency?

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,780
I know sometimes it's not,
but this one counts for sure.

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,200
These are really,
really rare, and I'm broke.

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,240
I look like an ATM to you...?

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,370
Too bad so sad,
Greedy Gus... Life lesson.

34
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,910
Awww!

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,750
The Reality Principle does like
to disabuse us of our whims...

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,130
Case in point:
this one's a dud.

37
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,470
Look...! He's metal...!

38
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,180
Huh?

39
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,310
I don't believe it...!
A metal oopa!

40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,390
And that's good?

41
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,730
Ahh! You bet it is!

42
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,940
Hhhh... Yes, well. You
would know better than I.

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,440
Thank you, Okarin.

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,320
"Hououin Kyouma."

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,820
Whatever. You're the best.

46
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,870
My name is a matter of--

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,450
Your attention, please.

48
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,700
Doctor Nakabachi's
conference is about to begin

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,330
in the 8th floor lecture hall.

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,670
All who are interested
are welcome to attend.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,800
Printed on the handouts
there in front of you

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,380
is more or less the
hard blueprint

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,970
for one of mankind's
oldest ambitions...

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,630
Of course...

55
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,640
The theoretical scaffolding
begs some explanation.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,310
As I'm sure you're aware,

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,220
mainstream science currently
boasts something like ...

58
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,390
"Okay, don't be mad.

59
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,940
I think I dropped my Oopa,
but I'm looking for it!"

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,310
Each separate
discipline involved...

61
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,860
"The, inter-dimensional
vectors of time travel..."

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,700
Doctor!!!

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,990
Save your questions until...

64
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,250
I have none, sir...!

65
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,910
I throw down the gauntlet as
to your "theory's" authorship!

66
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,250
Do you take us all for
babes in the wilderness...?!

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,420
Please! World lines?
Kerr Black Holes...?

68
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,710
Two words, sir:
"John Titor!" Oh, yes!

69
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,180
I submit to all and sundry that
you have shamelessly plagarized

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,300
the decade-old scratchings
of an internet meme!

71
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,260
Oh please...!
Far from it, my friend!

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,390
Titor's so-called theories
are borderline schizophrenic!

73
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,980
Well, you'd certainly be in
a unique position to know...

74
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,400
I wonder if you might indulge
us with a brief overview

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,440
of just where
your views diverge?

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,900
Excuse us.

77
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:39,740
H-Hey...!

78
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,160
Seriously? John Titor...?

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,240
Guy's got a point.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
There's, like,
similarities out the wazzu...

81
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,450
Hmph!

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Who in the Hell are you?!

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,750
I think that's my line.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,420
Uh... Beg pardon?

85
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,170
'Kay, so...

86
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,090
What were you trying
to tell me back there...?

87
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,130
Earlier I mean?

88
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,800
Earlier?

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,430
Quarter of an hour ago.

90
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,140
They let you outta
the nut house?

91
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,810
Hold on a second...
Makise Kurisu...

92
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,560
The published Makise Kurisu...

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,440
Okay, that's impressive...

94
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,690
I'm guessing you're a
grunt in some university lab?

95
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,520
Damn your eyes!

96
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,940
What is the
Organization playing at?!

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,150
Uh... I'm sorry...?

98
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,030
Look, I just wanted
to ask you about what--

99
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,070
And you're a fool
to expect I'll talk...!

100
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,790
Red Alert. I've been
cornered by an Agent.

101
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,580
Possibly a sleeper.
Certainly illustrious...

102
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,660
Who are talking to?

103
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,210
Fear not. I'll give her
the slip. Somehow. Perhaps--

104
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,590
Uh... It's... not on.

105
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,090
Hahahahaha!

106
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,630
Well...! You are a credit
to your training, madam...

107
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,180
Few discover the ploy...

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,890
This phone shuts
off automatically

109
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,930
in all hands but mine...

110
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,020
thus preserving the
integrity of my communications.

111
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,940
Great. You're crazy.

112
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,860
Clearly this is asking a lot,

113
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,820
but I need you to summon up
whatever focus you can spare.

114
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,570
Think back fifteen minutes...

115
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,780
You were trying your damnedest
to tell me something...

116
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,950
And going by the look you had on
your face, it was worth hearing.

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,160
Nice...

118
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,750
But don't think to ensnare
me with this gambit...

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,370
And rest assured,

120
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,460
when next we meet I shan't be
caught off guard so easily...

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,840
Uh...

122
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,420
Very well.

123
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,380
Wait, I...!

124
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,020
Clearly a lunatic... I think
I'd remember meeting her.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,490
Ah! There you are.

126
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,080
Mayuri! Where have you been?

127
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,870
What do you mean? I texted!

128
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,870
My oopa's gone missing!

129
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,500
I wrote my name on
it and everything...

130
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,880
D'you drop it somewhere?

131
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,800
Probably.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,760
Such is life.

133
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,970
Ah! You have any idea how much
a metal oopa goes for on eBay?

134
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,340
We're talkin' ten thousand yen!

135
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,430
Ten thousand yen?!

136
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,470
Yup.

137
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,770
Well don't just stand there!

138
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,480
That lil' bauble could be the
lab's ticket back to the black!

139
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,770
I'm not gonna sell my friend!

140
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,400
Just imagine all of the
gloriously wicked experiments

141
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,030
we could get off the ground with
ten thousand yen in the coffers!

142
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,570
I'm not gonna sell it. Don't--

143
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,960
Whoa...

144
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,540
Get outside!

145
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,890
Uh...

146
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,850
I know you're there...

147
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,830
Holy... Crap...

148
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,720
What's going on?

149
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
Your guess is as good as mine.

150
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,520
Hey, Okarin!

151
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,490
Hey you feel alright...?

152
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,820
'Cause you look like
you're about to throw up.

153
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,320
Someone's... been murdered...

154
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,780
The eighth floor...

155
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,360
Wha...? Uh...

156
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,470
What is going on...?

157
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,050
Too-too-roo! Bottoms up!

158
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,190
The Hell is this?

159
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,850
Um. A drink?

160
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,270
No, I mean...
Everyone just disappeared...

161
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,190
They did?

162
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,360
Yes! A moment ago
there were people here!

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Really?

164
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Stop kidding around!

165
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,160
You had to have seen it, too...!
Tell me you saw it, too!

166
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,370
I didn't.

167
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,870
This is ridiculous!

168
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,980
Don't play games...

169
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,860
I know you're watching...
That's right, freak...

170
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,730
It behooves you
nothing to ignore me.

171
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,900
Take a good look.

172
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,160
Quaff deeply from the
trough of Future Shock...!

173
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,990
Allow that wooly brain
to be stricken with envy!

174
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,290
You are speaking to
Member Double-O One...

175
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,160
Lab Founder, Evil Genius and
Mad Scientist extraordinaire...

176
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,000
'Tis I... Hououin Kyoma.

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
I still think that
Okarin sounds way cuter.

178
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,130
Silence...!

179
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,840
My nom-de-plume is for
special missions only...!

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,260
The girl, is known as
Double-O Two. My assistant...

181
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,890
Cosplayer and resident
female... Shiina Mayuri!

182
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,480
Too-too-roo! I prefer Mayushii.

183
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,060
Next up... I give
you Hashida Itaru...

184
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,860
Our... Hack...
Member Double-O Three!

185
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,280
Ugh. It's hack-er.

186
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,730
The way you say
it makes no sense.

187
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,650
These are The Members.

188
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,990
Stop third degree-in'
the lil' guy, will ya?

189
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,200
It's gettin' painful.

190
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Bad enough you yoinked him outta
the eighty percent off bin.

191
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,620
Heed me!

192
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,910
To find us,
pry open the tiny door,

193
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,580
hang a left at
Red Queen's Ersatz Botanical

194
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,590
and we're two blocks up
in the warehouse lofts

195
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,380
just before March
Hare's Haberdashery!

196
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,510
Chaos is our prime directive:
To pitch the world on its ear

197
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,720
via the maddest of
mad sciences...!

198
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,470
If you knew all of this prior,
continue to stare blankly...

199
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,480
Ah-ha! Just as I suspected!
Doff the charade, mutant!

200
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
Hey guys, you know what?

201
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,770
I was just thinking how weird
it would be if to Alpacaman,

202
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,320
we're the weird old piece
of discount software...

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Maybe we could stitch together
an eight-bit Turing Test slash

204
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,740
First Person Shooter
and find out.

205
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,280
Ooo! And we could use it
on your Two-D girlfriends

206
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,780
to see if they're
really into you.

207
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,330
They're not girlfriends; they're
a harem I worked very hard for.

208
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,040
No one wants to discuss
your den of iniquity.

209
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,210
We were just having
a lively back-and-forth

210
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,710
about the age-old question
of whether or not the world

211
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,710
as we know it isn't just
some high-rez RPG programmed

212
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,510
into existence by a
higher intelligence.

213
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:00,970
It's not.

214
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,130
How do you know?

215
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,890
Because as a concept,
it's absolutely bunk...

216
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,220
And because every moment
we fritter away pondering

217
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,560
such nonsense we lose
time more fruitfully spent

218
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,890
devising ways to unravel
The Organization's plan.

219
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,730
Hhhh... Oh, yeah. My bad.

220
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,810
Didn't mean to take us
down the rabbit hole there.

221
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,110
Hold thy tongue Hack...!

222
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,190
You are addressing

223
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,690
the rabbit hole's preeminent
denizen, Hououin...

224
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,490
...Kyouma!

225
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,950
I'm sorry, you said something?

226
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,870
Mark me, my porcine friend,

227
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,620
one of these days you'll
despair to have missed

228
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,580
even the least of my utterances.

229
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,170
Exactly why I back up

230
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,590
every insane outburst
in triplicate, chief...

231
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,880
Press chopper's gotta
be on the scene by now...

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,380
...several sources
independently confirmed

233
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,180
that the impact
occurred around noon...

234
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,470
The object appears
to be a satellite.

235
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,390
As you can probably judge
for yourselves at home,

236
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,220
it's massive.

237
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,480
Okay... Retracing steps...

238
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,020
Mayuri came with me to see Dr.
Nakabachi showboat this morning,

239
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,150
I remember that.

240
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,030
We left the lab
together, in fact...

241
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,530
We were standing in the doorway
of a half-empty lecture hall

242
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,950
when the crash happened...
But then what?

243
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,870
I did?

244
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,540
Yeah. I was right
there with you;

245
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
we saw the crash on
the news and you said

246
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,540
"The Organization has made its
move at last," or whatever...

247
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,130
Then we ran straight
there to have a good look.

248
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,050
Canceled?!

249
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,460
How can you be surprised?

250
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,550
You were rantin' sideways
about it this morning,

251
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,260
said the doc got cold feet...

252
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,640
No, no, no!

253
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,350
Nakabachi's lecture started
at twelve o'clock on the dot!

254
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,810
Sorry, dude. You're havin'
a stroke or somethin'.

255
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,140
It was cancelled.
Good thing, too.

256
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,480
They'd be scrapin' you

257
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,270
off the bottom of that
satellite if it hadn't been.

258
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,110
What in the Hell
is wrong with me...?

259
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,530
Has The Organization been
tampering with my memory?

260
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,950
Ah! Of course...!
It's absolutely clear!

261
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,990
Stein's Gate has chosen!

262
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,620
And here we go...

263
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,120
Another reference
no one gets but you.

264
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,330
Consider your audience
once in a while, huh?

265
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,340
Daru! Future Gadget #1!

266
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,750
Alpacaman's mad.

267
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,340
You changed the channel on him.

268
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,880
Here.

269
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,010
Thank you.

270
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,220
Damn you, Mr. Braun!

271
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,720
Your shoddy equipment
will be our death.

272
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,890
What'd you expect?
He gave it to us for free.

273
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,520
Hack! Hoist this fossil!

274
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,810
Give the hack thing a rest...

275
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,980
And no: it's a sauna out there.

276
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,110
Just 'cause I've got
some meat on my bones

277
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,860
doesn't mean I'm,
like... strong...

278
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,990
Mutiny!

279
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,910
Mr. Braun...!

280
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,250
Hey. It's Mr. Tennouji or
it's nothing. I told you.

281
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,750
I require repairs...
Now... Or else...

282
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,670
Huh? The Hell you
do with it now...? Ugh.

283
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,590
You psychos screw up everything
you lay your damn hands on...

284
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,220
It'll be a thousand yen.

285
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,680
Ah! That is outright
extortion, sir...!

286
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,970
I will not stand...

287
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,350
I could always toss you outta
your digs, if you'd rather...

288
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,390
Damn the vagaries of haggling.

289
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,980
When you gonna wise up and
run with a better crowd, girlie?

290
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,570
I don't think I really have a
choice. I'm a hostage, you know.

291
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,740
I swear. One of these days...

292
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,490
Are you kidding?

293
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,280
The electron gun's fried!
That'll cost you double.

294
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,820
Take it or leave it.

295
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,450
Your decision.

296
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,040
New development.

297
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,630
The Organization has
apparently hit Cue Ball

298
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,750
into the corner pocket...

299
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,840
Our enemies multiply.

300
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,130
Here.

301
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,300
Huh?

302
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,640
You sure guzzle that stuff
like it's going out of style.

303
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,150
To exemplary IQ's, this "stuff"
is nothing short of ambrosial.

304
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,580
Listen to them...
they're singing!

305
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,040
Daru! It seems our
landlord has finally

306
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
gone over to The Enemy,
as we've feared.

307
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,460
Our hand is forced... Plan
Omega must be set in motion!

308
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,760
Alrighty...

309
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,340
This is no time to be glib!

310
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,550
We must conduct a
verifiable field test

311
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,510
for Future Gadget Numero Eight!

312
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,430
Oh, right. The "Phone-wave
(Real Name TBA)"...

313
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,190
Okay... How do you "field test"
a kitchen appliance?

314
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,150
Three and a half
years now, yes...?

315
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,060
That's how long you and
I have known one another?

316
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,900
Only if we're countin'
the year and some change

317
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,860
of high school when we
were in different classes

318
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,400
and never said a
word to each other.

319
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,860
Details, details...

320
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,160
The point is, our friendship
spans the abyss of time...

321
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,790
One would imagine our thoughts
to be simpatico by this stage.

322
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,660
Heh. Scary thought.

323
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,000
If you wanna give the
R.E.N.G another whirl,

324
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,960
though, I'm down for it.

325
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,170
Banana, Double O Two!

326
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,880
Why? You're just gonna
nuke the poor thing...

327
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,420
You'll make it all icky.

328
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,550
Steel yourself, woman!
This is for science!

329
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,260
Well, it's your experiment...

330
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,180
Bet you'd think it
was pretty wasteful

331
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,100
if you paid for
these yourself, though.

332
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,390
Yes, yes.

333
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,190
Welcome to the Radioactive
Entre Navigational Gopher

334
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,650
for your Phone-wave.

335
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,820
To set time, press the
numerical keys corresponding

336
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,900
to the desired
allotment of seconds,

337
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,450
followed by the pound sign.

338
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,620
One-two-zero-pound.

339
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,250
Solid turntable action.
Clockwise.

340
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,580
Unique for a
microwave, I notice.

341
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,000
Clockwise?

342
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,000
There's significance buried
somewhere in that fact,

343
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,710
I can feel it...

344
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,920
Approached from a
quantum perspective,

345
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,420
Hand's rule of
maximum multiplicity...

346
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,010
Don't get ahead of yourself.

347
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,090
No, of course.

348
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,180
Thank you.

349
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,020
Typical result.

350
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,350
Great big gobs o'
greasy grimy gopher guts.

351
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,270
Doesn't do that to
my chicken tenders.

352
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,480
Maybe it's something about...

353
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,020
Perhaps, but the
consistency of its effect

354
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,690
on bananas tends to strengthen
my Stein's Gate hypothesis...

355
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,980
Just what I was thinkin'.

356
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,030
Stifle. Eat one
for verification.

357
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,780
Hells no.

358
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,820
So be it. The honors
go to you, my lovely.

359
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,700
Hmm... Do I have to? The bananas
get all gross and floppy.

360
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,040
I don't really like
the way they taste.

361
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,960
You've eaten one?

362
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,670
Mayushii...

363
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,540
Huh?

364
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,040
Could you give me
that spiel again...?

365
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,380
Only instead of
gross could you say wet?

366
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,170
Alrighty... The bananas
gets all wet and floppy.

367
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,470
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

368
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,090
Hopefully this gives
our viewers at home

369
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,930
a better view of this
thing's dimensions--

370
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,850
not to mention the
damage it's caused...

371
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,220
I'm totally dying here.

372
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,390
You've been outside
all of ten minutes.

373
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,690
Hey, put yourself in my shoes.

374
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,560
It's a lot farther
than a guy like me

375
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,520
usually ventures on
foot in the summer.

376
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,820
Why can't they do
it at Queen May's?

377
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,740
Because a college wants
nothing to do with a maid café.

378
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,580
Ugh... Yeah, well the
deans are beggin' me

379
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,620
to drop out with that attitude.

380
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,290
Whew! Air-conditioning!
I can feel the life coming back.

381
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,880
There's no way in
hell the satellite

382
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,000
can be just a coincidence.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,670
You still harping on that?

384
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,550
You're telling me you're
not the least bit curious

385
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,340
to see the crash site?

386
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,260
Like we'd see anything
through the crowd.

387
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,390
'Sides, I'm keeping tabs on the
whole shebang via the interwebs.

388
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,020
Ah... Extra vacation days...
Another holiday?

389
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,020
Wait a minute, of course...
Give me your phone.

390
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,770
What for?

391
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,610
Stop asking questions!

392
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,450
Violation of my basic
rights, douche bag!

393
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,700
I sent you a text.

394
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,950
About Makise Kurisu's murder...

395
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,040
Dude. That was
like so last week.

396
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,790
Last week?

397
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,500
You broke it up into
three parts... Spam monkey.

398
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,250
See?

399
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:32,920
Huh?

400
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,010
Received July 23rd,
12:56pm? What?

401
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,550
Yup.

402
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,340
What the...?
Hang on, my outbox...

403
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,100
Where is it? What's today?

404
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,890
Huh? It's the
twenty-eighth. Why?

405
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,140
Spill it.

406
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,770
My text... Traveled
backward in time...

407
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,770
What?
